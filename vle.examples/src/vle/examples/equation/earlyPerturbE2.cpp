/**
 * Notes : This unit test is used to fix a bug related to the perturbation
 * of DifferenceEquation::Multiple extension. When a dynamics based on
 * DifferenceEquation::Multiple extension is perturbated, a compute is called
 * even if all synchrone variables are not received. In this example,
 * at time 3, the variable fsa from PerturbE2 is perturbated before the synchrone
 * variable e1 is received. An error is raised if the compute function of PerturbE2
 * is called more than once.
